    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>Consider Google Business Listing the very first step in your web presence /  digital marketing campaign. Without this listing it makes it difficult for Google to categorize your business on their own and as a result, it becomes more difficult for your customers to find you.</p>
    <p>The listing is a formalized version of your business information: Address, phone number, hours, etc. When performing a search for local services, it is often referred to as the “3 pack”, which refers to the 3 local business listings at the top of the search results.</p>
    <p>Once confirmed, the business will start to appear in the local listings and you will have access to the dashboard and the many tools offered by Google to improve your local search ranking.</p>
    
    <h2>Why should I claim it?</h2>
    <p>By claiming your business listing and managing it on your own, your formalizing the information about your business, versus letting Google guess about this information.</p>
    <p>88% of consumers consult reviews before making a purchase.</p>
    <p>97% of consumers search for local products and services with a search engine, but only 37% of businesses have claimed a Google My Business local business listing.</p>
